Did you figure it out? If not, try running this:

    (factorial-almost -1)

<!--sep-->

    (factorial-almost 1/2)

Oops. The factorial operation is not well-defined for negative numbers or
fractions. It's easy to see why this doesn't work. Here's what ACL2 does:

> `(factorial-almost -1)` is n = 0? No. `(* -1 (factorial-almost (- 1 1)))` >
> `(* -1 (factorial-almost -2))` is n = 0? No.
> `(* -1 (* -2 (factorial-almost -3)))` is n = 0? No.
> `(* -1 (* -2 (* -3 (factorial-almost -4))))` etc.

This would continue forever if it wasn't for a recursion limit in the Lisp
interpreter. Instead, you get a "stack overflow" error.

That line about using `:program` mode is a way to get ACL2 to allow us to write
a function like this that may never terminate. Normally, ACL2 proves that
functions terminate when you define them. If you'd like, you can see what ACL2
does if we try to define `factorial-almost` normally:

    (defun factorial-almost (n)
      (if (= n 0)
          1
          (* n (factorial-almost (- n 1)))))

The result is a failed proof attempt. It's complex and hard to interpret, but
the jist is that ACL2 is telling us what we now know; `factorial-almost` doesn't
always terminate.
