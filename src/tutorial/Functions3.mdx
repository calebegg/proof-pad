You might be tempted to say "too bad, don't use it that way", which makes sense.
But with ACL2, our goal is to be able to prove theorems about `factorial`, and
it's impossible to prove anything about a function that might or might not
terminate. So in order to continue, we need a version of `factorial` that is
**total** -- that is, it returns a value no matter what the input is.

Thankfully, this is a common problem, and ACL2 has a solution. There's a special
predicate that will do what we want here. It's `zp` -- the "zero predicate".
What it says is, roughly, "check if the argument is a non-negative integer, and
if so, whether or not it's zero". If the argument is zero _or_ if the argument
is not an integer -- if it's one of the arguments we consider invalid for
`factorial` -- then we will return `1`. It might not make sense that
`(factorial -1)` is equal to `1`, but it isn't important for our purposes.

`zp` also uses an ACL2 feature called guards. This prevents you from calling it
with an invalid argument.

Now we can define `factorial` correctly:

    (defun factorial (n)
      (if (zp n)
          1
          (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
