Let's prove that the built in `append` function from earlier is associative;
that is, `(append (append xs ys) zs)` equals `(append xs (append ys zs))`.

    (thm (equal (append (append xs ys) zs)
                (append xs (append ys zs))))

This is a long, (but interesting!) proof. If you're interested in the details,
there's a good, relatively non-technical discussion of this proof by the authors
of ACL2
[here](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/manuals/current/manual/?topic=ACL2____The_02Proof_02of_02the_02Associativity_02of_02App).

For theorems that ACL2 can't prove on its own, you'll often have to provide
lemmas; theorems that are added to the ACL2 logical world and can then be used
in proving future theorems. To add a theorem to the logical world, use
`(defthm ...)` and give it a name.

    (defthm append-associative
      (equal (append (append xs ys) zs)
             (append xs (append ys zs))))

One final note before we move on to more advanced theorems.

Theorems added using `defthm` must be written with care; the prover blindly
replaces the left side with the right side whenever it finds something that
looks like the left side and can prove all of the `implies` hypotheses. If we
admitted a different version of append-associative that converted
`(append xs (append ys zs))` to `(append (append xs ys))`, the theorem prover
would loop forever, applying these two rules repeatedly.
